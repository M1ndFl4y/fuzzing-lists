Explanation of use.

Password expiration combined with restrictive password history policy leads to predictable password use. The password structure contained in the password-expiration.txt are listed by successes from past pentests. Change the year to keep them up to date with a simple find and replace. 

Try old years as well. If the user hasn't logged in since the password expiration an old year may work and you could be prompted with a password reset.
